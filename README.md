Meal Tally is an android and web application that has been created as part of a hackathon for the non profit organization - San Jose Public Library. The SJ Public library runs a meal program to feed children and adults who cannot afford a healthy meal.

This app helps reduce the paper work involved in the process for the volunteering staff at San Jose Public Library and also enables them to easily track and share the data related to meals served with different venors and authorities.
